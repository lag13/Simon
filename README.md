Simon
=====

I was taking the train home on 07/19/15 and ended up sitting next to and talking with a
fellow programmer we'll call him Jeff. Jeff had plans to create the game
"Simon" for his daughter using an arduino and on the train he wrote a software
version of it. I thought it would be a fun little project so I made my own
version.
